# Jo Smith Photography

This project was an assignment from my HND in Web and Mobile Development at Glasgow Clyde College.

## Project Brief

The project brief was to complete a static HTML and CSS portfolio for a fictional freelance photographer named Jo Smith. 

The website was to include a photography gallery, information about Jo Smith and the rates she charges for her work, her social media accounts and their most recent posts (using APIs).
